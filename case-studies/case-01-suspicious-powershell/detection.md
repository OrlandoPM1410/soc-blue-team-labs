# Detection

## Detection Source
The activity was detected through endpoint telemetry generated by Sysmon and Windows Event Logs.

## Signal Description
An alert was triggered based on the execution of `powershell.exe` with suspicious command-line parameters indicative of script execution and potential misuse of built-in system tools.

Key indicators include:
- PowerShell execution with encoded or obfuscated commands
- Unusual command-line flags (e.g., `-EncodedCommand`, `-NoProfile`)
- Execution initiated by a non-administrative user

## Detection Logic
The detection focuses on identifying PowerShell executions that deviate from typical user behavior and match known patterns of abuse.

This logic is aligned with MITRE ATT&CK technique:
- **T1059.001 – PowerShell**

## Initial Assessment
Based on the command-line characteristics and user context, the activity is considered suspicious and requires further investigation.
