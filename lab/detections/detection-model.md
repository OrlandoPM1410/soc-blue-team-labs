# Detection Implementation Model

Detections in this lab follow a structured workflow:

1. Select MITRE ATT&CK technique
2. Identify suspicious behavioral indicators
3. Translate behavior into SPL query
4. Validate ingestion
5. Convert query into scheduled alert
6. Perform controlled execution for validation
7. Document limitations and future improvements
