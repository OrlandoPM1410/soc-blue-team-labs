# soc-blue-team-labs

Hands-on SOC / Blue Team case studies focused on detection, investigation, and incident response.

## Scope
This repository documents practical SOC-oriented scenarios using real telemetry (e.g., Windows Event Logs and Sysmon) to simulate, detect, and analyze security-relevant activity.

The focus is on:
- Detection engineering
- Alert triage and investigation
- Incident response decision-making
- Lessons learned from each scenario

## Structure
- `lab/` – Overview of the lab environment and tooling
- `case-studies/` – Documented SOC scenarios (end-to-end analysis)
- `detections/` – Detection logic and rules used across cases

## Disclaimer
All scenarios are simulated in a controlled lab environment for educational and professional development purposes.
